# Getting started examples

The [Web3.Storage GitHub repository][github-main-repo] contains some example projects to help you get started with the Web3.Storage JavaScript client library. The examples are stored in the [`packages/client/examples` directory][github-examples-dir] and include code for Node.js and several browser toolchains.  Each example directory has a `README.md` explaining how to install dependencies and run the code.

Here's a brief look at how to run the Node.js example:

1. First, clone the Web3.Storage GitHub repo:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/web3-storage/web3.storage
    ```

1. Move into the NodeJS example folder and install the dependencies using NPM:

    ```shell
    cd web3.storage/packages/client/examples/node.js 
    npm install
    ```

    ```shell output
    added 232 packages, and audited 233 packages in 10s

    42 packages are looking for funding
      run `npm fund` for details

    found 0 vulnerabilities
    ```

1. Run the `put-files.js` script, along with the associated variables:

    ```shell
    node put-files.js --token="your-token" ~/file.txt
    ```

1. That's it!

Running the script is easy, but to really learn how things work, you should take a look at the script itself! Open it up in a text editor and play around with the functions. One of the best ways to learn how something works is by breaking it.
